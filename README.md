This folder contains 1 site diagram and 7 wireframes without considering  login and registration pages.
I  made sign in  and sing up pages as a subpages of login/registration page and drew what they look like when each subpage gets clicked. In a nutshell, sign in and sign up pages are bundled in login page.


The Description page leads to details of the product(house) and location when it gets clicked on Buy and Rent pages.
Additionlly, to show the website is responsive I uploaded home wire frame for mobile devices.
